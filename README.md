Hi

  My name is Filip, and I'm a beginner programmer.
My journey with programming started when I was 11, but back then, because lack of willingness, I dropped it.
I was trying my strength witch C++, because I always loved games, and I wanted to be a part of something bigger, that I can aid with my skills.
This year, I started again, and I just simply fall in love with it. Right now, I spend my time at learning, and trying to type a better and more complicated code to expand my skills.

  Here I can show you what and how I code, and what projects I've made.;

Enjoy :)
