## Introduction
Hi,

  My name is Filip.
My journey with programming started when I was 11, but back then, due to lack of willingness I've dropped it.
I've tried my strength with C++, because I have always loved games and I wanted to be a part of something bigger.
This year, I've started again, and I just simply fall in love in programming. Right now, I'm spending my time on learning, and trying to develop a better and more complicated code to increase my skills.

Enjoy :tada:
